# Minesweeper
A minesweeper game project that I created using Python and the Processing development. Game hosts
the three original modes, 9x9, 16x16, and 24x24 square sizes and has most of the original
game's functionality.

## Getting Started
Instructions for downloading and running the program on your machine.

### Prerequisites
- Processing.py 3.5.3 (to run through the IDE)
- Java version 7
- Java JRE

### Installation
Run the program through Processing environment or see [Processing Webpage]
(https://py.processing.org/tutorials/command-line/) for running through the
command line.

## Usage
- Run minesweeper.py
- Click one of the three boxes to choose your game mode
- Left click to select a square
- Right click to place tags on a square
- Try to avoid all the mines
